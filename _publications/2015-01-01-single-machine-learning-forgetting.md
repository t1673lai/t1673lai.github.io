## Research Overview

This research note investigates single-machine scheduling problems where both learning and forgetting effects are present, with a novel model based on sum-of-processing-time rather than traditional position-based approaches. The proposed model includes several existing models as special cases, providing a comprehensive framework for scheduling optimization.

## Key Contributions

**Theoretical Framework:**
- Develops a sum-of-processing-time-based model for learning and forgetting effects that generalizes existing approaches
- Provides mathematical formulations that capture realistic learning and forgetting patterns in manufacturing environments
- Establishes the theoretical foundation for optimal scheduling under dual learning-forgetting dynamics

**Optimal Solutions:**
- Derives optimal solutions for various single-machine scheduling problems under the proposed model
- Addresses multiple objective functions including:
  - **Makespan minimization**
  - **Total completion time optimization**
  - **Total weighted completion time minimization**
  - **Total tardiness reduction**
  - **Maximum lateness minimization**

**Mathematical Analysis:**
- Provides several helpful lemmas to prove optimality conditions for different objective functions
- Demonstrates the computational tractability of the proposed model
- Shows how the sum-of-processing-time approach offers more realistic modeling of human learning behavior

## Impact and Significance

Published in Applied Mathematical Modelling (Volume 39, Issue 2, Pages 415-424), this work extends the theoretical understanding of scheduling problems with human factor considerations. The sum-of-processing-time-based approach provides a more realistic representation of how workers learn and forget in industrial settings compared to position-based models.

The collaborative research with Chia-Huang Wu and Wen-Chiung Lee demonstrates the importance of incorporating both learning and forgetting effects in scheduling theory, contributing to more accurate production planning and workforce management strategies.
