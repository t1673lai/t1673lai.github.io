# Welcome to Peng-Jen Lai's Academic Portfolio

I am Peng-Jen Lai (賴鵬仁), a Professor of Mathematics at National Kaohsiung Normal University, Taiwan. My research focuses on geometry, soft computing, and exploring mathematics with shareware tools like GeoGebra and Python. I'm passionate about using computational tools to explore mathematics, generative arts, and puzzles, constantly seeking innovative ways to make mathematical concepts more accessible and engaging.

This website showcases my research work, publications, teaching experience, and professional activities spanning over three decades in academia.

Research Interests
======
My research spans several interconnected areas in mathematics and computational exploration:

- **Geometry (幾何學)**: Mathematical structures, spatial relationships, and geometric problem-solving
- **Soft Computing (柔性計算)**: Fuzzy logic, neural networks, and computational intelligence approaches  
- **Exploring Mathematics with Shareware (以自由軟體探索數學)**: Using open-source and free tools to discover mathematical concepts and patterns
- **Generative Arts**: Creating mathematical art through computational methods and algorithmic design
- **Mathematical Logic Puzzles and Artificial Intelligence (數理邏輯益智遊戲與人工智能)**: Problem-solving strategies and AI applications in mathematical contexts

Technical Skills & Tools
======
I work with various programming languages and mathematical software:

**Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C, R  
**Mathematical Software**: GeoGebra, Matlab, Maple  
**Current Learning Focus**: Advanced Python applications, GeoGebra for interactive mathematics, Mathigon for educational content

Collaboration & Outreach
======
I actively seek collaboration with educators, researchers, and anyone interested in exploring mathematics with shareware tools. My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional mathematics education and modern computational approaches, making mathematical concepts more accessible through interactive and visual methods.
